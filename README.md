# React Native Module Resolution Error

This repository demonstrates a common React Native error where a third-party library fails to resolve correctly, even after installation.  The issue is often related to improper linking or configuration of the native modules within the library.

## Bug Description:
After installing a third-party library (e.g., using npm or yarn), the React Native application fails to build or run, throwing an error indicating that a module or component from that library cannot be found. This is despite the library appearing to be successfully installed in the project's `node_modules` directory.

## Solution:
The solution typically involves ensuring the native modules of the third-party library are properly linked to your project. This might involve running specific linking scripts provided by the library, or manually configuring the native project files (Android's `build.gradle` and iOS's `Podfile` and Xcode project).  See the `RNModuleErrorSolution.js` file for a corrected example.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Install the problematic library (replace `react-native-xyz` with the actual library name).
2. Attempt to import and use components from the library in your React Native app.
3. Observe the module resolution error during compilation or runtime.
