This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that hasn't been properly linked or configured.  It might manifest as a runtime error indicating that a module or component cannot be found, even though you've installed it via npm or yarn. For example, you might try to import a component from a library and get an error like `Unable to resolve module 'react-native-xyz'`.
